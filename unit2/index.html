    <h1>Setting Goals for Your Site</h1>
    <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
    <p>I am inspired by the websites for the film <a href="http://lifeaccordingtosam.com" target="_blank">Life According to Sam</a> and the ad agency <a href="http://thisisdk.com" target="_blank">Digital Kitchen</a>.

    <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
    <p><strong>Life According to Sam</strong> is my dream site for the film I'm working on. I love just about everything about the site beginning with the simple progress bar beneath the white title treatment on a black background as the page loads. As it relates to space, the focal point of the landing page is the title treatment 'Life According to Sam' which is centered above award logos that are evenly distributed at the bottom of the page, and the negative space is actually an embedded video clip from the film that spans the entirety of the page. The video has some sort of mask over it which seems to lower the brightness and intensity of the video such that it does not draw your attention away from the focal point. What I especially like about the site is the use of film stills and other images to fill the negative space of each page. This allows the site to act as a gallery (a neat feature is that you can 'x' out of the content/copy to reveal the full-bleed image behind it) meanwhile providing useful information about the movie, the filmmakers, screenings etc.</p>
    <p>I think the site could benefit from reexamining the hierarchy/balance on their 'About Sam' page. The numbering of the questions in the circles at the bottom of the page can seem at a glance like some sort of rating system or call to action for the user, rather than serving the purpose of the page as a Q&A with Sam. My attention is immediately drawn to the numbers in the circles, and not on the questions and answers. As it is, the visual weight and emphasis is on the numbers at the bottom of the page, where it should be on the Q&A.</p> 
    <p><strong>Digital Kitchen</strong> begins as an infinite scroll site that takes you through each of the subpages and the focal point of the landing page is the phrase "Expect Greatness" which actually doubles as the progress bar (neat!). Similar to Life According to Sam, the 'logo' is white over dark negative space - in this case a fully gray background. Every 'sub-page' upon scrolling downward has a slightly different background to help differentiate between the pages. For example, it goes gray, to textured gray, back to gray, then a full-bleed image of sneakers, to gray, etc. In regards to balance, the site is very grid-based in its design. Clicking the navigation bar located on the top right will take you to their sub-pages - clients, work, about, people, etc. All of these are organized very cleanly using grids. Some are evenly balanced in columns (i.e. the 'clients' and 'people' page) and some are unbalanced (i.e. the 'work' page).</p>
    <p>I think the site could benefit from reexamining the space for their 'capabilities' subpage in the scroll. I think there is too much copy and for the infinite scroll, they should stick to one-liners.</p>

    <h2>What makes them similar?</h2>
    <p>Both Life According to Sam and Digital Kitchen have full page scroll where you can move from page to page through some sort of navigation (up/down/right/left arrows, mouse, etc.) outside of the navigation bar. Both sites demonstrate grid-based design (LATS with the gallery page and DK with its work/clients/people pages). The layout of navigation bar and logo/title treatment is also similar for both sites - navigation bar at the top right of the page, and logo top left. All of these are aspects that I would like to incorporate into my final site.</p> 

    <h2>What makes them different?</h2>
    <p>While both sites have full page scrolling, DK's site can be navigated by scrolling using your mouse/trackpad as well as using the navigation arrows on the keyboard. LATS, on the other hand, requires clicking on arrows located on the pages if you're using mouse/trackpad (can't scroll), or using the navigation arrows on the keyboard. Another big difference is that DK breaks out of the infinite scroll setup and allows the user to navigate through the site more like a "traditional site" where the pages don't fully shift in one direction or another. LATS keeps you in the full page scroll layout. This speaks to the purpose of each site - LATS is a film site (more visual and less information needed to be conveyed) and DK is a company site (overall a lot more information to be conveyed and visuals incorporated regarding work, people, clients, contact info, etc.). </p>
