    <h1> About Jessica</h2>

    <p>I'm a producer living in Los Angeles, CA. I'm currently line producing a documentary and worked at a few startups before that. I first became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development at my very first job out of college where I was tasked to find a way to place our live-stream player on a customized Facebook tab (when you're the youngest, you're pretty much automatically asked to do all things social...) It was a real doozy and after hours of researching, I finally figured it out and felt like a total badass! Long story short, I've always worn some sort of amateur design and dev hat in my past roles, and even my current one where I'm needing to make a website for the film. So I'm really hoping this course will help me build a solid foundation and open up new paths for my career!</p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>

    <p>As I learn more about front-end, I first hope that it will be as enjoyable as I've thought it to be, and second, that I'll be able to build an awesome site for the film. Baby steps! After that, I may look into the web dev immersive program.</p>
