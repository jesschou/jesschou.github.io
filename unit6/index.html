		<div class="synopsis">
			<p>From the Producers of the most viewed 2013 TEDxWomen event, comes a documentary based on 25 year old, 58 pound, Lizzie Velasquez. Born with a rare syndrome that prevents her from gaining weight, Lizzie was first bullied as a child in school for looking different and later online as a teenager when she discovered a YouTube video with 4 million views labeling her "The World's Ugliest Woman." Lizzie's story proves that there is life on the other side of bullying and that self-worth and compassion are essential in getting there.  The film chronicles unheard stories and details of Lizzie's physical and emotional journey up to her multi-million viewed TEDxAustinWomen talk, and follows her pursuit from an event speaker to Capitol Hill activist, hoping to help the issue of bullying reach a higher road.</p></div>
